====================
Python Bowie Console
====================

This is a flask server that provides a simple web UI to control Bowie's functions.

Components
==========
* Flask
* AngularJS
* AngularMaterial

Current Status
==============
This UI simply provides buttons and a switch for binary functions, a joystick for driving and a video area
that contains a still image for now. The serial communication needs more work, but packets should be sent
properly. Incomming serial data is not handled yet.
